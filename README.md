You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a word, and the user has to guess which letters are in the word that the app chose. Put the following text on your page


* hit any letter to start off the game
* you are given the length of the word
* if you guess the correct letters within the amount of guesses give you win
* if you guess wrong letters, you will add pieces to the hangman
* if you run out of guesses before the hang man is put together, you lose
* if you beat the riddle you will win, if you create the hangman you lose
* game will reset if you win or lose
